  # Since this is designed to be run before the cluster knows anything about the argocd CR, we need to use helm hooks to control the ordering
  # This means that the cluster argocd resource is deployed as a helm hook rather than a managed resource
  # This has the side-effect that every time you run "helm upgrade" argocd will be deleted and recreated
  # It should not affect the applications
